The Microsoft Ads Python Software Development Kit (SDK) Version 13.0 enhances the experience of developing Microsoft Ads applications
with the Python programming language using REST APIs.
The SDK includes proxy classes for all Microsoft Ads API REST endpoints and abstracts the low level details of authentication with OAuth.
You can also read and write bulk files with the SDK BulkFileReader and BulkFileWriter,
and use the high level BulkServiceManager interface to abstract and execute operations in the Bulk API.
